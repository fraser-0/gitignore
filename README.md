# gitignore

A personal collection of `.gitignore` templates. 

GitHub has a repository of `.gitignore` templates [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
However, I have found the templates aren't fit for my purposes. 
The `.gitignore` file for this project can be used as the base for new templates.
From here add any language template you want below the `# Language ignores below here` line.
Each language template starts with a comment to explain what language and/or frameworks being ignored.
Concatenate as many language templates to the base template as you want.
Add any project specific ignores to the top of the base template where directed, after concatenation.
